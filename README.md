# Device Groups

With this app you can group devices with the same capabilities as one device.

After installing add a new groupingDevices from the devices tab.
Now select the group device's class. (e.g. Light).
On the next page you will see all the capabilities supported by this class, now chose the ones you need. (e.g. onoff and dim).
Now on the last page you will find all devices that match these capabilities, select the devices you want to group and finish the pairing process.

Now you have one device to control all the grouped devices.
